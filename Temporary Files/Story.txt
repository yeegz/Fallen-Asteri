Story Time

Main Character turns out to be the villian

People don't realize where the fallen star has went

the legend of the Fallen Star is nothing more than the Developer sending a virus to the game and consuming it's code source to test how the npcs react to the environment 

Enemies are nothing more than the protectors of the Land and aren't close to the NPCS so they don't realize who is the evil one

The source code of this world is in the temple shining red making the player think that is where the fallen star landed when he is the so called fallen star

as you progress there will be mini quests helping some npcs doing so changes the character little by little changing him from a red colored person to a white colored person althought optional
